Introduction
========================================================

### About Diabetes
Diabetes is a condition developed when human body resists or fails to make enough insulin, a hormone that helps glucose from blood to reach cells to produce energy. As a result the glucose remains in blood and its amount increases over time resulting in Diabetes. In 2019, 3.6 million Malaysians had diabetes disease, highest in Asia and one of the highest in the world.An alarming 7 million adults (31.3%) aged 18 and above, both diagnosed and undiagnosed are estimated to be affected by diabetes in Malaysia by 2025.

### What do we want to achieve in this Project?
Our core objective is to develop an interactive and free app by integrating machine learning model using R programming to predict if a particular observation is at risk of developing diabetes. The PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset(csv format) used in this project is downloaded from Kaggle and is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

### Sample Raw DataSet:

Data Pre-processing, Visualization & Model Implementation
========================================================

### Data Pre-processing & Visualization 
<font size="5">To reach our goals of predicting Diabetes from the dataset under consideration we have performed the following activities:
  * Data Cleaning
    * Detect missing value.
    * Ensure the font case for continous variable is standardized.
    * Check the decimal points for numeric variable is consistent.
  * Exploratory Data Analaysis
 
After data preparation and EDA,  the cleaned output was taken on which the below machine learning models were implemented using R to check the accuracy. Finally, the model with highest accuracy was picked and incorporated into DiabetesApp

### Model Implementation
<font size="5">  
* Implemented Models and Accuracies
    * Logistic Regression [75.32%]
    * K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [74.03%]
    * Support Vector Machine(SVM) [74.68%]

Experience & Conclusion
========================================================

### Experience Summary

  * The experience of completing this assignment has been very enriching and empowering for each of us as we have performed as a team and presented us a wide learning opportuinity.
  * Being amateurs, initially it was challenging for us to deal with Shiny App, R Packages, slidify and R-presentation, but guidance and references helped to ease out our tasks.

### Conclusion

While we have chosen the model with higher accuracy among the ones under evaluation, yet this application is for an initial state prediction and for raising awareness beforehand. The results cannot be considered final. Therefore users are adviced to consult a physician and take necessaery steps for an actual diagnosis.
